I found a few different videos that helped me piece this together. Some had sliders to determine the length of the password using bootstrap stylings but I didn't really like it yet. I'm going to start compiling a few small projects like these so I can actually use a few bits of code that we do along the way. Seems like an easy enough password generator, and it'd be pretty cool to use your own "program". 

Not sure why the links to the images aren't working but the password generator should work fully!
